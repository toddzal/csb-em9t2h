In addition, the TMB30 has plenty of low end that sustains. Whether you are a beginner or looking for a second bass, the TMB30 will deliver!\\n\\nReflecting a classic Ibanez body style, the Talman Bass Series sports a cool retro look with a sound that will inspire players of all ages. While Talman basses normally have the more common 34\u201d long-scale neck, the TMB30 offers a short-scale 30\u201d neck. The shorter neck is often preferred by players of smaller stature who find a long-scale instrument to be unwieldy. It is also a favorite of guitarists who double on bass\u2014 the shorter scale having a feel closer to that of an electric guitar.\\n\\nThe TMB30 features include a poplar body for a warm, punchy tone, a maple neck with jatoba fretboard, a B10 bridge, and a black pickguard to complete the classic vibe. Electronics consist of an Ibanez Dynamix P neck pickup and a Dynamix J bridge pickup for that rich, vintage sound.","msrp":189.99},{"id":12,"product_key":"gsrm25_02","manufacturer":"Ibanez","url":"https://www.ibanez.com/usa/products/detail/gsrm25_02.html","pic_url":"https://www.ibanez.com/common/product_artist_file/file/p_region_GSRM25_BK_1P_02_en_1.png","product_name":"GSRM25","neck_shape":"GSRM5","scale_length_in":28.6,"scale_length_mm":726,"radius_in":12,"radius_mm":305,"neck_material":"Maple","neck_finish":null,"fingerboard":"Jatoba","no_of_frets":22,"fret_size":"Medium frets","zero_fret":false,"nut_material":null,"nut_width_in":1.77,"nut_width_mm":45,"inlays":"White Dot","body_material":"Poplar","body_top_material":null,"body_back_material":null,"body_finish":null,"body_shape":"GSRM","pickguard":null,"pup_config":"SS","pup_neck":"Std.
